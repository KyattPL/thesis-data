";not realy, i wanted to get to the bottom of this and see if i can guess the murderer;i disliked the NPCs that said lots of bad things about others. i think it's what made me suspect the murderer the most and it's a nice touch on the author's part;looks like this game was quickly made specfically for an assignment. not too bad;2;2;1;2;2;1;1;1;2;2;4;4;4;2;5;2;2;1;1;a bit bored, but this time it was different because i knew who was the murderer;i checked if the lines were the same and just skipped them;lowkey skipped most of it;interesting to point out the details in each other's stories and words

Except for a couple of ""not enough previous conversation history"" messages, they were indistinguishable from real players.";At first, the game was kind of boring, and I was surprised when asked to ask ANY 10 questions. I thought for sure that the canned responses wouldn't be able to handle that. But the NPCs talked just like real players.;Yep! They offered helpful responses to most of my questions.;I believe this is an experiment about LLMs, which I wholeheartedly support!;3;3;3;2;2;2;1;2;2;2;2;3;2;3;4;3;2;2;1;I was just clicking through canned responses like the boring beginning of the game.;I guess I got my hopes up from the first game, so I was excited.;Not especially.

It might be better if you had the NPCs picture next to their names at the end

So when I click on the second questions, I aware that it is going to be bored quickly;no, that's surely not talk;can mix between the two methods, since it will add definitive questions (hint) to start the conversation with NPC. And adding option to add random questions for other purposes (speedup the game, go directly to something,...). Those two characteristics is like Last Epoch game item drop: randomness -> increase drop rate, definitiveness -> exchange with other users.

The NPCs had unique backstories and personalities, although they seemed a bit confused sometimes;Yes;NPCs were a bit confused at times and gave wrong information, mixing up other characters (e.g., Mary and Sylvia) and sometimes repeated themselves.;3;2;1;1;3;3;1;3;3;3;4;5;2;4;5;3;1;3;3;It was easier and more straightforward than the open-ended text box, but less immersive and I was less interested in the characters.;It was interesting to learn about the characters and their relationship to each other. Information was easier to attain than with the text box as the characters had fixed answers to the questions presented.;Yes;Less immersive than the text box version and I found myself losing interest/skimming the text because the motion of going through each character and their questions was repetitive and became almost automatic. Better in terms of cohesiveness and structure, as the characters had set answers to give. I assume because the other version uses AI their answers are confused and sometimes outright wrong, but with improvements, I would prefer the text box version of the game as it feels more interactive, less draining, and fully immersive in the story and the NPCs.

I noticed their unique traits kind off went gone (Not panicking so much or nervous through the text, or having their own unique accents) the moment I started asking them questions. The NPCs that did catch my attention is Florian and Randy. For Florian, there were some sensitive questions I asked to him and he said ""I'm not uncomfortable saying that"", while Randy did not go too much into details, became evasive with his answer, and did not specify where he went somewhere else. The other times I did find something interesting is either when they were able to give me some useful information, or something was off with the line of information (Mary saying Sylvia is not a criminal investigator but Randy said she is also a detective).";"Much interested since they were able to give me some useful information through the questions I have to form carefully. Each of them gave me info where I can see that they have info that others don't know, although I did wish they don't feel a bit way too ""objective"" and strangely similar with their way of words with other guests.";Yes, there were many times I had to save and load slots just to see their different answers, and had to experiment a bit more on the questions I formed off. Although, I did get eventually frustrated with the amount of questions I felt compelled to ask.;"- Game keeps crashing when I loaded my saved slot on a part where I had to type my question
- I think some nice little background music would make the game experience more immersive
- I actually became interested with the type of software used in the game
- Noticed also another bug where I loaded my saved slot on a specific text after I asked them a question, and a line of text I wanted to see has already disappeared from the history
- Hmm, more expressions with the NPCs?
- I wish the ending was more interesting, such as the police now going to the villa and interrogating each of the guests, which then eventually reveals who is the real murderer. Can also add guests' reactions about the accusation
- Felt way too longer than usual while I was playing. Maybe I got affected by the max amount of questions I had to ask (Compelled to ask ""all"" possible questions)
- Overall, even if this is just some experiment, the game is very interesting since this is my first time to play a game where I had to type a question I formed myself and the NPC actually answers it without being ""way too off"" about the context of the game";1;5;5;5;5;5;1;1;1;4;1;4;5;5;5;5;1;5;4;"NPCs have more personality than in the previous version. They have their own way of words and personal feelings and thoughts towards another person. They even show remorse about Sylvia's death sometimes. I was able to actually gather information about what truly happened to other guests before her death, unlike in the previous one where NPCs just can't answer it properly. I can also clearly see what the NPCs know and don't know, unlike in the previous one where it felt like ""every NPC knows everything"" even though it's not exactly the case.";"Very interested, since I managed to get a lot of new info that I wasn't able to get in the previous one (Adam actually liking Sylvia, Nathaniel actually threatening Sylvia based from what Florian said, Sylva feeling like being ""stalked"" by Florian, more descriptions about Randy's crimes, Nathaniel liking Adam and his perspective on Florian, Nathaniel and Mary's good relationship and his POV on her, Randy seemingly more nervous and ruder than in previous version). Out of all the NPCs, I would say the most interesting is still Randy, since out of all the guests present, he's the only one who talked about how suspicious Florian is and talks bad about everyone except Nathaniel, which I didn't see in the previous version (just always being evasive about my questions but didn't see any glimpse of his rude personality despite describing himself as arrogant and violent).";Much more so than in the previous version, since it actually felt more like talking to a real human, with most of their feelings and thoughts showing in the conversation, while also being actually seemingly more objective than in the previous version (even if what they're saying is a lot shorter than in the previous one).;"- I caught a glimpse of the author's actual imagination, story, and writing in this version
- A lot, lot faster than in the previous version when it comes to questioning, although a bit biased since I already know the whole story. However, it did take me less than an hour for this one
- Unlike in the previous version, despite the questions now only having to choose through choices and not through open-ended way, it felt more objective, informative, and relevant
- Didn't feel much frustrated unlike in the previous version since I didn't have to think about the proper questions to ask them
- Noticed more misspellings on current version than in previous version. Interesting irony though. Version B has no grammar errors but most information shown can be irrelevant, while Version A has plenty of grammar errors shown such as misspellings but more objective and relevant when it comes to information
- I think a bit of a problem is, its a bit unclear here regarding the info relating the actual crime scene (e.g. cause of death for Sylvia) but maybe that's just me
- Overall, I noticed that in the previous version, the NPCs' texts felt more of generative AI, but this version is the actual writer's text. I realized there really is more creativity found in a human than in an AI, and this experiment convinced me that, making me less anxious about AI"
